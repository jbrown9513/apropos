# Agent Instructions Cleanup

## Request
Remove references to BugDB and work-related context from agent guidance.

## Why
This project should stay focused on personal/local development context and avoid workplace-specific workflows.

## What Changed
Updated `AGENTS.md` wording to remove remote/work-oriented phrasing and keep guidance centered on local project use.
