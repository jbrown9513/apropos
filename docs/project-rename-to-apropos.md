# Rename Project Book to Apropos

## Feature request
Rename the project from `project-book` to `apropos` across the repo and runtime-facing names.

## Why this is implemented
The project identity should be consistent in package metadata, UI labels, environment configuration, and generated config paths. Keeping one canonical name avoids confusion when running the tool, sharing setup steps, and locating files under the home directory.
