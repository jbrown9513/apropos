# Project MCP Dropdown Add Remove Create

## Overview

The workspace `MCP` dropdown now centers on project-configured MCP servers.
It now supports three direct actions in one menu:

- Remove currently configured MCP servers from the active project.
- Add available MCP servers discovered from the active project's MCP catalog.
- Add a new MCP repository URL for the active project and create a new MCP server via the draft skill.

## Why

Project MCP workflows should be direct and project-local.
Users need to see what is already configured, add from project sources without extra navigation, and remove stale MCP servers quickly.

This keeps MCP management in a single interaction surface and aligns with project-scoped MCP repositories.
