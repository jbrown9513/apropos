# Soft Mystic Greek Theme Palette

## Overview
Refined both light and dark theme palettes to feel softer and more atmospheric, with a “paper + Aegean dusk” direction.

## Why this was changed
The previous light theme felt too stark and white, while the dark theme had harsh, high-contrast tones that felt synthetic.

## What changed
- Reworked dark palette into muted, desaturated navy/slate tones.
- Reworked light palette into warm parchment and soft olive-tinted paper tones.
- Reduced harsh saturation in terminal tile accents and active states.
- Updated top-bar controls and dropdowns to match the softer palette.
- Restyled the `apropos` title with a classic serif treatment to match the “soft mystic greek” brand context.

## Result
The dashboard now reads as calmer, warmer, and more cohesive in both modes, while preserving readability and visual hierarchy.
