# Home Menu Gray Reduction Dark Palette

## Overview
Adjusted the home/dashboard dark-mode surfaces to reduce grayness and use warmer Aegean tones.

## Why this was needed
The main menu still felt too gray and flat after the broader palette refresh.

## What changed
- Recolored `projects-wrap` and project cards with deeper blue-ink gradients.
- Updated folder tabs, badges, and home metadata text to match the new dark palette.
- Reduced neutral gray elements in key home-screen controls.

## Result
The main menu reads less gray and more cohesive with the soft mystic visual direction.
