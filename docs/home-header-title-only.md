# Home Header Title Only

## Overview
Simplified the home header so it displays only the `apropos` title.

## Why this was changed
The subtitle text made the header feel noisy and repetitive relative to other status copy on the page.

## What changed
- Removed the descriptive subtitle line under the `apropos` heading.

## Result
The home header is now cleaner and focused on the product title only.
