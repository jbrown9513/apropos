# Light Mode Aged Parchment Micro Pass

## Overview
Applied a final light-mode micro-tuning pass to shift the palette toward aged parchment.

## Why this was changed
Light mode still carried slight cool/gray notes in some surfaces and borders.

## What changed
- Warmed base background gradients toward soft ochre.
- Shifted panel, workspace, and dropdown surfaces to richer parchment tones.
- Recolored borders/hover states to reduce gray and improve cohesion.

## Result
The light theme now feels more like warm papyrus than bright neutral beige.
