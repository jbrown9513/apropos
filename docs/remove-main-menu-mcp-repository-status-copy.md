# Remove Main Menu MCP Repository Status Copy

## Overview

Removed the main menu status text that showed MCP repository count and project-scoped messaging.

## Why

The status line was noisy and in some cases rendered duplicated copy.

Removing it keeps the header cleaner and avoids confusing repeated text in the main menu.
