# AGENTS editor plain mode

The `AGENTS` action now opens a plain editing mode without extra editor chrome.

## What changed

- AGENTS view hides the editor header/title and metadata controls.
- AGENTS view shows just the editable content area and bottom actions.
- Bottom action text now uses `Exit` instead of `Cancel`.

## Why this was implemented

AGENTS editing should be direct and focused on file content. Extra headers and mode controls made this flow noisy and distracting.
