# Project Alerts Auto-Ack On Entry

## Overview

When entering a project workspace, Apropos now automatically acknowledges (clears) all alerts tied to that project.

## Why
Project-scoped alerts should represent pending attention.

If alerts persist forever after switching into the project, the notification list becomes stale and noisy.

Auto-acknowledging on project entry keeps notifications focused on unresolved work in projects you have not yet opened.
