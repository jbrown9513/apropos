# Popup close icon standardization

Updated popup/header close controls to use the same `X` icon treatment instead of a text `Close` label.

## Why this was implemented

Mixed close affordances (text in some popups, icon in others) made the interface feel inconsistent.

This change aligns editor and dialog headers with the same visual close pattern used elsewhere in the app.
