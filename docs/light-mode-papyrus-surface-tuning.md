# Light Mode Papyrus Surface Tuning

## Overview
Refined light mode to feel more papyrus and less stark, especially in dropdown and menu surfaces.

## Why this was needed
Light mode still looked too white and dropdowns felt visually harsh against the softer brand direction.

## What changed
- Warmed light-mode background and panel tokens toward parchment tones.
- Softened workspace surfaces to match the papyrus palette.
- Retuned dropdown/menu hover and active states for gentler contrast.
- Updated toolbar/MCP dropdown surfaces so they match the same paper-like treatment.

## Result
Light mode now reads as warmer, softer, and more cohesive across menus and controls.
