# Workspace Refresh Project Restore

## Overview

Refreshing the page now keeps you in the current project workspace instead of dropping back to the main Projects view.

## Why

Project continuity should persist across refresh.

The update hardens project-route parsing and adds a lightweight active-project restore path, so workspace context is preserved when the page reloads.
