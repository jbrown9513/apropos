# .gitignore Baseline

## Overview

Expanded the project `.gitignore` from a minimal list to a practical baseline for Node.js development and local Apropos runtime use.

## Why

This prevents noisy local files from being committed by accident, including dependency installs, logs, temporary build/test artifacts, environment override files, and local `.apropos` runtime state when `APROPOS_HOME` is pointed inside the repo.
