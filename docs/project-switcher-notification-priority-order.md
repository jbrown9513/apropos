# Project switcher notification-priority ordering

Updated the project switcher dropdown ordering to prioritize projects with the highest notification counts.

## Why this was implemented

When triaging work from the switcher, the highest-signal projects should appear first.

Sorting by notification volume makes it faster to jump directly to projects that need attention.
