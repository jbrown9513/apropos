# Claude/Codex Project Context

- You are working on Apropos the vibe-coders dream

- When you are working on a specific feature or functionality, write to docs/*.md with an overview of the feature request, (or bug), and the why it is implemented. Do not worry about writing the overly technical aspects of the changes, as these will evolve overtime

- Projects are local directories where we can run codex/claude code. MCP servers and skills are added per project.

- Do not worry about backwards compatibility
